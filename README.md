Abstractâ€” Driver fatigue is a leading cause of road accidents.
This research presents a real-time driver drowsiness
detection system using deep learning, optimized for lowpower
embedded systems. By compressing a complex model
into a lightweight version, the system achieves an 85.5%
accuracy in detecting various alertness states while
maintaining energy efficiency. Utilizing facial landmark
tracking and the Haar-Cascade method, the approach
ensures fast and accurate detection, making it ideal for realtime
vehicle safety applications. The system's integration into
modern vehicles promises enhanced driver fatigue
management and accident prevention.
Keywords: Drowsiness Detection, Low-Power Systems,
